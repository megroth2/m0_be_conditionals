# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- Its useful to use a `conditional` in code when you want to include logic to do different things based on different conditions. Since conditionals result in boolean values (either true or false), including conditionals in your code is an easy way to make sure all possible scenarios are covered.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- The first step I took in the m0_be_conditionals directory was I ran `git init` and got a message that it had been "reinitialized." I should have run `git status` first to see if it had been initialized already.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- I remembered most of the git steps on my own without having to check my notes and was able to accurately predict the git status most times as well! It also was pretty easy to know when to commit changes logically since the challenges were broken up into different files. I think the git concepts are becoming more clear now.
